      "url": "/products",
      "hasDifference": true,
      "differencePercentage": 5.2
    }
  ]
}
```

## What You Get

For each comparison, you'll find:

üìÅ **var/visual-diff/job-20240101120000-abc12345/**
- `job.json` - Comparison results and metadata
- `images/A/` - Screenshots from Base A (reference)
- `images/B/` - Screenshots from Base B (comparison)
- `diffs/` - Visual diff images showing differences

## Understanding Results

The extension shows **ONLY pages with differences** that exceed your threshold.

**Example output in job.json:**
```json
{
  "jobId": "job-20240101120000-abc12345",
  "status": "completed",
  "results": [
    {
      "url": "/products",
      "hasDifference": true,
      "differencePercentage": 5.2,
      "imagePathA": "var/visual-diff/.../images/A/products.png",
      "imagePathB": "var/visual-diff/.../images/B/products.png",
      "diffImagePath": "var/visual-diff/.../diffs/products.png"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Common Use Cases

### Case 1: Production vs Staging
Compare production with staging before deployment:
```
Base A: https://www.mysite.com
Base B: https://staging.mysite.com
Pages: /, /products, /checkout
```

### Case 2: Before and After
Compare same site at different times:
```
Base A: https://www.mysite.com
Base B: https://preview.mysite.com
Pages: /, /homepage, /landing
```

### Case 3: Multi-Version Testing
Compare different versions:
```
Base A: https://v1.mysite.com
Base B: https://v2.mysite.com
Pages: /, /features, /pricing
```

## Tips

üí° **Scheduling:** Run during off-peak hours (e.g., 2 AM) for better performance

üí° **Threshold:** Start with 1.0% and adjust based on your needs
- Lower = more sensitive
- Higher = less sensitive

üí° **Page Selection:** Start with critical pages:
- Homepage
- Key landing pages
- Checkout/conversion pages
- Contact forms

## Troubleshooting

### wkhtmltoimage not found
